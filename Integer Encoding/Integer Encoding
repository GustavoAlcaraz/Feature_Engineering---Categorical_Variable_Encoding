## Integer Encoding

Integer encoding consist in replacing the categories by digits from 1 to n (or 0 to n-1, depending the implementation), 
where n is the number of distinct categories of the variable.

The numbers are assigned arbitrarily. This encoding method allows for quick benchmarking of machine learning models. 


### Advantages

- Straightforward to implement
- Does not expand the feature space


### Limitations

- Does not capture any information about the categories labels
- Not suitable for linear models.

Integer encoding is better suited for non-linear methods which are able to navigate through the arbitrarily assigned 
digits to try and find patters that relate them to the target.


## In this demo:

We will see how to perform one hot encoding with:

- Feature-Engine

And the advantages and limitations of each implementation using the House Prices dataset.
