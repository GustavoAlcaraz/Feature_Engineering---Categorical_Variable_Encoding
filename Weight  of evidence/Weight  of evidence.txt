Weight  of evidence

Weight of Evidence (WoE) was developed primarily for the credit and financial industries to help
 build more predictive models to evaluate the risk of loan default. That is, to predict how likely
 the money lent to a person or institution is to be lost. Thus, Weight of Evidence is a measure of
 the "strength” of a grouping technique to separate good and bad risk (default). 

- WoE will be 0 if the P(Goods) / P(Bads) = 1, that is, if the outcome is random for that group.
- If P(Bads) > P(Goods) the odds ratio will be < 1 and,
- WoE will be < 0 if,  P(Goods) > P(Bads).

WoE is well suited for Logistic Regression, because the Logit transformation is simply the log 
of the odds, i.e., ln(P(Goods)/P(Bads)). Therefore, by using WoE-coded predictors in logistic 
regression, the predictors are all prepared and coded to the same scale, and the parameters in 
the linear logistic regression equation can be directly compared.

The WoE transformation has three advantages:

- It creates a monotonic relationship between the target and the independent variables.
- It orders the categories on a "logistic" scale which is natural for logistic regression
- The transformed variables can then be compared because they are on the same scale. Therefore, 
it is possible to determine which one is more predictive.

The WoE also has a limitation:

- Prone to cause over-fitting
