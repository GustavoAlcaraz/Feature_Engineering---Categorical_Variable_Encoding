## Comparison of Categorical Variable Encodings

In this lecture, we will compare the performance of the different feature categorical 
encoding techniques..

We will compare:

- One hot encoding
- Replacing labels by the count
- Ordering labels according to target
- Mean Encoding
- WoE

the exercise is based on the notes of:
