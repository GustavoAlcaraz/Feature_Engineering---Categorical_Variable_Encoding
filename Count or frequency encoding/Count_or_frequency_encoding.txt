## Count or frequency encoding

In count encoding we replace the categories by the count of the observations that show that category
 in the dataset. Similarly, we can replace the category by the frequency -or percentage- of observations
 in the dataset. That is, if 10 of our 100 observations show the colour blue, we would replace blue by
 10 if doing count encoding, or by 0.1 if replacing by the frequency. These techniques capture the 
representation of each label in a dataset, but the encoding may not necessarily be predictive of 
the outcome. These are however, very popular encoding methods in Kaggle competitions.

The assumption of this technique is that the number observations shown by each variable is somewhat 
informative of the predictive power of the category.


### Advantages

- Simple
- Does not expand the feature space

### Disadvantages

- If 2 different categories appear the same amount of times in the dataset, that is, they appear in 
the same number of observations, they will be replaced by the same number: may lose valuable information.

For example, if there are 10 observations for the category blue and 10 observations for the category
 red, both will be replaced by 10, and therefore, after the encoding, will appear to be the same thing.
